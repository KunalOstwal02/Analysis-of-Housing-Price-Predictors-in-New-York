# Analysis of Housing Price Predictors in New York

Using the dataset of housing prices in New York city that identifies the
price and the distinguishing features of each home, we hoped to find out
whether there is an accurate way to predict the price of a home based on
its specific characteristics. It was found through using a combination of
simple regression, comparison of a backward and forward model and by
comparing the performance of a multivariate regression model to that of
the simple regression model that the variables with the highest correlation
to housing prices in New York and therefore serve as the best predictors of
Price are Living.Area, Land.Value and Bathrooms with Living.Area having
the best rate for prediction of overall Price
