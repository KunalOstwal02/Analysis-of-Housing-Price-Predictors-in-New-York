\begin{abstract}
Using the dataset of housing prices in New York city that identifies the
price and the distinguishing features of each home, we hoped to find out
whether there is an accurate way to predict the price of a home based on
its specific characteristics. It was found through using a combination
of simple regression, comparison of a backward and forward model and by
comparing the performance of a multivariate regression model to that of
the simple regression model that the variables with the highest
correlation to housing prices in New York and therefore serve as the
best predictors of Price are Living.Area, Land.Value and Bathrooms with
Living.Area having the best rate for prediction of overall Price.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The USA was hit hard by the COVID pandemic and New York City in
  particular was the hardest hit city worldwide.
\item
  Hence, the New York real estate market is a buyer's market with total
  sales to listing ratio of 0.12 i.e.~the supply of homes is much higher
  than the demand for homes. Hence, it is a buyer's market.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Since the data is a part of a bigger, more comprehensive dataset, the
  datasets are already cleaned and nonw of the cells are empty.
\item
  There is an extra variable \texttt{Test} which is not a part of the
  original Saratoga dataset. Since we don't have a description of it, we
  omit it from our analysis to remove any confounding factors from the
  result.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{analysis-exploration}{%
\subsection{Analysis (exploration)}\label{analysis-exploration}}

There are a number features of the data set such as
\texttt{Living.Area}, \texttt{Age}, \texttt{Land.Value}, that seem like
they ought to prima facie have a strong correlation with \texttt{Price}.
Indeed, a heat map of the correlation between each pair of variables
shows a number of interesting things.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{Final-Report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1} \end{center}

The features \texttt{Bathrroms}, \texttt{Rooms}, and \texttt{Land.Value}
all have a strong correlation coefficient with \texttt{Price}; -
surprisingly, \texttt{Age} has a small relationship with \texttt{Price};
- less suprisingly, \texttt{Living.Area} has the greatest correlation
coefficient with \texttt{Price} of \(0.71\).

\begin{itemize}

  Consequently, we decided to produce a simple linear model between

  \[y = 12844.1787 + 113.3729 x\].

\begin{itemize}

\item
  In generating a multi-variate linear model, we used the Forward
  Stepwise Function (FSF) and the Backwards Stepwise Function (BSF).
  They both produced the same model:
\end{itemize}

\[\text{Price} \sim \text{Living.Area} + \text{Land.Value} + \text{Bathrooms} +\\ \text{Waterfront} +     \text{New.Construct} + \text{Heat.Type} + \text{Lot.Size} + \\\text{Central.Air} + \text{Age} + \text{Rooms} + \text{Bedrooms}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The factors: \texttt{Pct.College}, \texttt{Fireplaces},
  \texttt{Sewer.Type}, \texttt{Fuel.Type} were not added to the model by
  the FSF and were excluded by the BSF.

\item
  Linearity: The residuals plotted in the univariate model appear

  above zero, therefore the data is assumed to be linear.
\item
  Homoskedacity: In the univariate model, it appears the variance is

\hypertarget{normality}{%
\paragraph{Normality}\label{normality}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The majority of points lie close to the diagonal line in both QQ
  plots, however, there are many outliers in the upper tail so the
  normality assumption is moderately well satisfied.
\item
  Furthermore, we have a large sample size, and so can use the central
  limit theorem to justify approximately valid inferences under a
  normality assumption.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics{Final-Report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1} \end{center}

\hypertarget{independence}{%
\paragraph{Independence}\label{independence}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We take it for granted that the data has been independently
  collected.\\
\item
  Since it is a random sample of a larger dataset, the data is assumed
  to be void of any confounding factors related to sampling and
  therefore, we assume there is independence between error terms.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{performance-analysis}{%
\subsection{Performance Analysis}\label{performance-analysis}}

\hypertarget{in-sample-performance}{%
\subsubsection{In-sample Performance}\label{in-sample-performance}}

Here we compare the performance of the multivariate regression model to
that of the simple linear regression model within the dataset.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simple Model \(R^2\): 0.5090615
\item
  Multivariate Model \(R^2\): 0.6548216
\end{itemize}

As we can see, the multivariate model has a better goodness of fit
compared to the univariate model.

\hypertarget{out-of-sample-performance}{%
\subsubsection{Out of Sample
Performance}\label{out-of-sample-performance}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We chose Mean Absolute Error over Root Mean Square Error since there
  are several outliers in the data.
\end{itemize}

We compared the mean absolute error of the two models.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  MAE(Univariate Model) = \ensuremath{4.697515\times 10^{4}}
\item
  MAE(Multivariate Model) = \ensuremath{4.173576\times 10^{4}}
\end{itemize}

The multivariate model has the lower mean absolute error, as such it has
better predictive than the univarite model.

\hypertarget{fold-cross-validation}{%
\subsubsection{10-fold Cross Validation}\label{fold-cross-validation}}

We performed a 10-fold cross validation test on the two models.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsubsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

From our analysis it was found that the top three variables with the
strongest ability to predict housing price were Land.Value, Living.Area
and Bathrooms. Of these three variables, Price and Living.Area have the
highest correlation relationship. When thinking about these results, it
seems quite clear that the size of a property would increase the price
and the larger the property, the more likely the higher the Land.Value.
Bathrooms are an interesting addition, however, it would be fair to say
that the larger a house is the more bathrooms it is likely to have.
While these seem like obvious predictors of housing prices, these
potential assumptions are backed up by the analysis we have undertaken.

In answer to our inference: what is set of features that best predicts
\texttt{Price} we found that:

\[\text{Price} \sim \text{Living.Area} + \text{Land.Value} + \text{Bathrooms} +\\ \text{Waterfront} +     \text{New.Construct} + \text{Heat.Type} + \text{Lot.Size} + \\\text{Central.Air} + \text{Age} + \text{Rooms} + \text{Bedrooms}\]

Provides the best fit of the linear models we tested. It's \(R^2\)
indicated a good fit

\hypertarget{discussion-and-conclusion}{%
\subsection{Discussion and conclusion}\label{discussion-and-conclusion}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Our analysis found that the multivariable model generated by the FSF
  is a good predictor of house prices, and improves the accuracy of any
  univariate linear model, having satisfied the assumptions required of
  a linear model.
\item
  Our analysis did not investigate the trends of subgroups of price
  (such as \texttt{Fuel.Type} and \texttt{Energy.Type}. As such, there
  may be unexplored trends that give rise to situations such as
  Simposn's paradox. Further limitations include the collection of data
