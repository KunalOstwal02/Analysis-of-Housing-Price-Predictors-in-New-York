The increase in housing prices in New York has resulted in many home buyers questioning where and what they can buy, therefore, being able to accurately predict house price based on its attributes is of growing importance. Our analysis led us to the conclusion that there are specific attributes that can help predict housing price, and by using a simple linear model between living.Area and Price we discovered that these two properties had the highest correlation relationship. It would make sense that the size of a home would correlate to an increase in house price, and therefore the need for this prediction may not entirely be necessary. However, in sample performance using a multivariate model, the other variables with the strongest prediction value were highlighted. Bathrooms were found to be a strong predictor of house prices, and showed a trend towards increased price with increased bathroom amount. 

While the models are clear and hold in predicting housing prices in New York City there are still limitations to our research. The data used to create the models has a significant number of outliers which have the potential to sway any clear results that may be obtained. Our research also does not investigate trends of specific subgroups of price (such as Fuel.Type) and therefore there may be trends that give rise to situations such as the Simpsons paradox which may decrease the accuracy of the model prediciton. 

In summary, our analysis found that the multivariable model generated by the FSF is a good predictor of house prices, and improves the accuracy of any univariate linear model, having satisfied the assumptions required of a linear model.
